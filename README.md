# Golfer_Elbow_Massage
This is a repository for a research project that I did on the effects of massage therapy on a client's golfer's elbow.
## Summary
<p>Over the course of 4 weeks, I massaged a client with golfer's elbow (medial epicondylitis). After each time he worked out, he rated his pain level in his left elbow on a 7-point Likert scale for 9 different exercises involving elbow and wrist flexion (e.g., preacher curls, lat pulldowns). After the 4 weeks, his pain level while performing lat pulldown (V-grip) improved significantly, showing a pearson correlation of 0.84 with the number of cumulative massage hours, and coefficient of 1.79 and a p-value of 0.00 on a linear regression analysis.</p>
